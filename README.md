## Overview
We will be re-creating the classic puzzle game Tetris. To accomplish this, we have a
Shape Class and a Board class. In unison, these classes will allow for different pieces to
spawn, rotate, move, fall, and clear lines.

As a MVP (minimum viable product), we have all the Tetris pieces including their rotations. These pieces are able to fall down, get pushed down all the way and be held for future use. Once a line is completed, that line will be
deleted and the player will be awarded points. The player will have the ability to hold pieces as well as see
what the next piece will be.

For our final product, we added various features to make the game more appealing and exciting.
Some of these features include a transparent image of the block at the bottom to indicate to the player
where their piece is going to land, a menu option for players to change various settings, and different
game modes the player can choose to play.


## Instructions
Tetris!
The objective of Tetris is to complete as many lines as possible by utilizing
various block combinations in order to not run out of space. By completing lines you will earn points
and by earning points you can get a new high score!

Please look at the diagram below to see what certain keys do!
